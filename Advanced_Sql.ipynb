        "It is based on a single table\n",
        "\n",
        "It contains direct column mappings (no calculations)\n",
        "\n",
        "It does not use features that change row structure\n",
        "\n",
        "In such cases, the database knows exactly which row and column in the base table should be updated.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of an Updatable View\n",
        "Base Table\n",
        "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
        "    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
        "    name VARCHAR(50),\n",

        "WHERE emp_id = 101;\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ This works because:\n",
        "\n",
        "The view references one table\n",
        "\n",
        "No aggregation, joins, or computed columns are used\n",

        "Why Some Views Are Read-Only\n",
        "\n",
        "A view becomes read-only when the database cannot reliably determine how to apply an update to the base tables.\n",

        "3. Derived or Calculated Columns\n",
        "CREATE VIEW emp_bonus AS\n",
        "SELECT emp_id, salary, salary * 0.10 AS bonus\n",

        "\n",
        "5. GROUP BY, HAVING, UNION\n",
        "\n",
        "Any view using these clauses is read-only because rows no longer map 1-to-1 to base table rows.\n",

        "Key Idea to Remember\n",
        "\n",
        "🔑 A view is updatable only if each row in the view corresponds to exactly one row in a single base table.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Improved Performance\n",
        "\n",
        "Stored procedures are precompiled and stored in the database.\n",
        "\n",
        "Execution plans can be reused, reducing parsing and optimization time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Less network traffic since only the procedure name and parameters are sent, not the full SQL.\n",
        "\n",

        "CALL GetEmployeeByDept('IT');\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "instead of sending a long SELECT query every time.\n",
